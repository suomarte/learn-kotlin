# learn-kotlin

As a Java developer, I want to learn Kotlin. In this repository, you'll find what came out of it.
I hope you, the reader, will find something worthwhile in this journey too.

## Jump into the code

Here is the link to interesting part - the actual code for learning the Kotlin Concepts:

[LINK TO CODE](app/src/test/kotlin/dev/suomarte/learn/kotlin).


## Test-driven learning

To stay on track, I'm loosely following this tutorial, but I'm writing my own examples to help us learn more
effectively: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-hello-world.html

The actual code for the examples is written as tests. Each test case represents a specific Kotlin concept I want to learn.
This way, my learning experience can be directly documented as code and, in many cases, executed as a test.
